# Contribute

Welcome to the Guidelines and Recommendations for Publishing Agricultural-related pollinator data repository!

These guidelines are designed to make it as easy as possible to get involved. If you have any questions that are not discussed below, please let us know by opening an [issue](https://github.com/zedomel/worldfair-agrobio/issues/new/choose)!

Before you start you will need to set up a free [GitHub](https://github.com/signup) account and sign in. Here are some [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).

## Joining the conversation

Most of our discussions will take place on open [issues](https://github.com/zedomel/worldfair-agrobio/issues).

## Contributing through GitHub

- [git](https://git-scm.com/) is a really useful tool for version control.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) sits on top of git and supports collaborative and distributed working.

Youâ€™ll use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) to chat in issues and pull requests on GitHub. You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub to render the text with formatting. For example you could write words as bold (**bold**), or in italics (*italics*).

GitHub has a helpful page on [getting started with writing and formatting Markdown on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).

## Recognizing contributors

We welcome and recognize all contributions from documentation to testing to code development. You can see a list of current contributors in the contributors tab.

# Thank you!
