## Introduction

Metadata standards refer to established guidelines or specifications defining how metadata, which provides information about data, is structured, formatted, and described. These standards ensure consistency and interoperability in describing data elements, aiding in their organization, discovery, and management. They outline rules for creating, storing, and managing metadata to ensure uniformity and comprehension across different systems, making it easier to exchange, locate, and interpret various types of data.

The are different types of metadata which can overlap or complement each other, and their application depends on the specific needs of data management, retrieval, and usage within different contexts;

- **Descriptive Metadata**: this type describes the content and context of the data, providing information such as titles, abstracts, keywords, and summaries that help users understand what the data is about.

- **Structural Metadata**: it outlines how the components of a dataset are organized, including information about relationships, hierarchy, and sequence of data elements. Structural metadata might describe tables, fields, and their relationships.

- **Administrative Metadata**: it includes details about ownership, access rights, versioning, provenance (data origin), creation and modification dates, and other aspects relevant to data governance and stewardship.

- **Technical Metadata**: this type encompasses technical details about the data, such as file formats, sizes, data types, encoding schemes, software used to create or modify the data, and technical specifications necessary for data processing or interpretation.

- **Rights Metadata**: Rights metadata contains information regarding intellectual property rights, licensing, restrictions, and permissions associated with the data, ensuring compliance with legal and ethical considerations.
