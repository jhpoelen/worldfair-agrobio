# Data Standardization

Data standardization is the process of transforming data into a common format or structure to ensure consistency, comparability, and compatibility across different datasets or systems. It involves cleaning, formatting, and organizing data to adhere to predefined norms or guidelines, making it easier to analyze, integrate, and share information effectively.

In the biodiversity domain the [Biodiversity Information Standards](https://tdwg.org) (TDWG) is a non-profit organization and a community dedicated to developing biodiversity information standards. The TDWG is involved in developing, ratifying and promoting standards and guidelines for the recording and exchange of data about organisms; and acting as a forum for discussing all aspects of biodiversity information management through meetings, online discussions, and publications. A list of all standards in TDWG auspicius can be found at: [https://www.tdwg.org/standards/](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/).

Among the TDWG standards, the Darwin Core standard is widely used to document occurrence data.
> It includes a glossary of terms (in other contexts these might be called properties, elements, fields, columns, attributes, or concepts) intended to facilitate the sharing of information about biological diversity by providing identifiers, labels, and definitions. Darwin Core is primarily based on taxa, their occurrence in nature as documented by observations, specimens, samples, and related information.

Despite it has been initially defined for occurrence data, it has been used for documeting other kinds of data, such as biotic interactions. Due its flexibility and capability to be extended it has been used within other vocabularies and ontologies.


## Biotic interactions and the Darwin Core standard

The Darwin Core (DwC) provides many different terms for documenting biotic interactions.
